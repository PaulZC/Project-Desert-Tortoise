TODO
[ ] Add in total execution time summary for recorded files (for benchmarking porpoises)

COMMONLIBS
Sept 27, 2016
-Lowwpassfilter.c
--Added skipping of zero stuffed places to remove the interpolation penalty

Sept 25, 2016
-Reversed idea to use bytesync.c as a common library due to the fact that packetized and nonpacketized streams have a different needs. Perhaps these could be POESbytesyc and ARGOSbytesync to avoid updating the two versions each time?
-included stdint.h to wave.c to cover int16_t data_in_channel because mingw suddenly stopped compiling it	
-IDEA! Unlock (or even reset) the PLL if the quality estimator is very low for a long time-- we may have a false lock on a nearby signal

POES POST
Sept 27, 2016

Sept 25, 2016
-Restored archived bytesync.c
--Reverted two passed variables that were needed to decode universal streams (length and offset) -- now specific again
--Syncrhonized updated 'long idx' to 'unsigned long idx'
--Synchronized 'memset(historyBufferCirc, '.', sizeof(char) * syncWordLength);' to 'memset(historyBufferCirc, 48, sizeof(char) * syncWordLength);'
--Syncrhonized addition of 'i' to inverted frames
-Fixed typo: WAS DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPA  SB DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPHA
--Setting to 0.00005 for POES (as it is for POES REALTIME)
-Added output file date and time naming
-fixed bug where check for filename was done after trying to use it -- with expected results

POES REALTIME
Sept 25, 2016
-Restored bytesync.c from POES POST using updates documented
--Reverted function call in main to old format (removed two passed variables)
-Fixed typo: WAS DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPA  SB DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPHA

ARGOS POST
Sept 27, 2016
-Forgot to free buffer for logsignalstream. Fixed.
-Implemented raw data output upon command line flag
Sept 25, 2016
-Fixed typo: WAS DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPA  SB DSP_PLL_LOCK_ALPHA
-Restored archived bytesync.c
--Reverted two passed variables that were needed to decode universal streams (length and offset) -- now specific again
--Syncrhonized updated 'long idx' to 'unsigned long idx'
--Synchronized char one char zero and char byte to be static
--Synchronized 'memset(historyBufferCirc, '.', sizeof(char) * syncWordLength);' to 'memset(historyBufferCirc, 48, sizeof(char) * syncWordLength);'
--Changed minorFrameShiftFlag to packetShiftFlag
--Changed minorFrameFile to packetFile
--Changes minorFramesFound to packetsFound
--commented out POES specific syncword write to log file, but probably should put ARGOS specific?
-Added magic numbers to defines list
-Uncommented the PLL locksig squelch function
-Updated DSP_AGCC_GAIN 0.0015 from 0.001 to sync with latest ARGOS REALTIME which was newest branch
-updated DSP_PLL_ACQ_GAIN and DSP_PLL_TRCK_GAIN from 0.0015 to 0.015 based on testing of wave data
-added program greeting and build date
-various synchronizations of form to ARGOS REALTIME build
-Updated status printout text to say packets instead of frames
-Added output file date and time naming
-fixed bug where check for filename was done after trying to use it -- with expected results

-Restored archived bytesync.c
--Reverted two passed variables that were needed to decode universal streams (length and offset) -- now specific again
-Quick test decoded 5/5 packets in 12-21-56_401650kHz.wav when played back using audacity (0.5 output volume)
-Observation: When I increase the chunksize it shifts the time axis -- this shouldn't happen?
